# LouisvilleKY*GoodReads*Books
## Objective

The goal of this project is to compare physical book (print books & audiobook cd‚Äôs) inventory data of the Louisville Metro (KY) Free Public Library system with GoodReads.com‚Äôs print book & audiobook popularity ratings data.
Are there any trends or correlations between the GoodReads popularity of physical books and the Louisville Free Public Library‚Äôs inventory?

Some people think public libraries are obsolete because of the rise of ebooks, but the Louisville Metro Free Public Library system is bustling with patrons today, even for physical books. GoodReads is a website with 90 million international users, where readers can share critiques and compile personal lists of books that interest them (it does not sell or publish books). The hope is this project can be used to figure out whether Louisville is well*equipped for the global popular demand for certain books and media.

An assumption is that international GoodReads book/media demand may be similar to Louisville's book/media demand. The GoodReads data provides some potential insight into demand since it only includes the ‚Äútop‚Äù books they‚Äôve got listed on their site. The Louisville Metro Data/Library system does not provide such details to the public about their demand or decision*making process, so there is not much available to make the most educated guess. This exercise will display final visuals that may shed a light on interesting trends or lack thereof.

## Methodology

The GoodReads data used is noted on Kaggle as the top book publications from 1/1/1980*12/30/2023 and their current ratings, reviews, and ‚Äúwant to read‚Äù count. ‚ÄúWant to read‚Äù is a public user feature similar to ‚Äúliking‚Äù on social media, where users can note that they want to read a certain book. The Louisville Metro library inventory data was compiled on 3/1/2024 and it gives basic detail of all items owned by the library system, even if they‚Äôre currently being borrowed by library users. All 2024 publications in the library database were removed to allow more closely related time ranges. All electronics and ebooks were filtered out from both datasets.

The raw data used in this program was acquired from Louisville Metro Open Data and Kaggle.com via the below links.

## Questions
1 How many physical book copies does the Louisville Library system have of the popular physical books on GoodReads? 1
2 Does the number of editions of a particular book available thru the library correlate significantly to GoodReads popularity? 2
3 Does the GoodReads book value/price correlate to Louisville Metro library inventory? 3

## Programming Methodology
1 Reading CSV files in via Pandas(Python) in Jupyter Notebook 1
2 Cleaning & Combining data via Pandas Merge, and using some DataFrame summaries. 2
3 Visualizations via Tableau. 3
4 Virtual environment to ensure compatibility. 4
5 Annotations via Jupyter Notebooks & README. 5

## Data Cleaning Goals & Considerations:
* Created a relational database including a Books table, GoodReads Popularity table, & Library Inventory table.
* Added a total library copies column, removing the branch name column.
* Added a total versions/editions column to avoid ambiguity around different publications of the same book, removed duplicates of the same title & author as such.
* Removed other duplicates from both datasets.
* Removed ebooks & electronics from both datasets, to leave only physical books & audiobooks.
* Removed post*2023 publications from the library dataset.
* Removed irrelevant item types such as the library ‚ÄúLaptop‚Äù.
* Cleaned up publication dates and author names to match across tables.
* Replaced blanks or invalid values when useful.
* *GoodReads Ratings >= Reviews by count, because users can rate without reviewing. But reviewers must rate.*
* *Raw Library data * Each line is one copy of an item.*
* *Raw GoodReads data * Each line is one recording of data (some duplicates).*

*Raw Louisville Metro Library Data Makeup*
* 1.07MM rows and about 20 columns
* Each line is one copy of an item
* Authors formatted as last name comma first name, some blanks
* Some blank ISBN‚Äôs
* Some publication years look invalid (0, 120, 150, 2025) & months or days not provided
* Some blank item collections/genres
* Some items with 0 price, items like ‚ÄúLaptops‚Äù with high prices
* No index

## Conclusion

*While correlation does not necessarily equal causation, the following are what we can say about these datasets.*

* The Louisville Metro Free Public Library system has 255 physical unique books (by Title & Author) that are in the 3,752 GoodReads' physical books listings. They have over 1Million physical books outside the GoodReads physical books listing database.

* The strongest significant correlations I found among the two datasets were all between the GoodReads measurements themselves.

*Moderate Correlations:*
* *Sometimes*, physical books that the library holds *more* than 1 Edition of draw in *more* GoodReads users to Rate the physical books out of 5 stars, vs books that the library holds only 1 Edition of.

* Sometimes, physical books that the library holds *more* than 1 Edition of have a *larger* quantity of GoodReads user notings of "Want to Read", vs books that the library only holds 1 Edition of.

* Sometimes, GoodReads physical book listings with *higher* Ratings out of 5 will have *higher* Numbers of Ratings, Numbers of Reviews, users noting "Want to Read", *and* users noting themselves as a "Current Reader".

*Strong Correlations:*
* We can also say that *more often than not*, if a GoodReads physical book listing has a *high* Number of Ratings, then it also has a *high* Number of Reviews, users clicking the "Current Reader" button, *and* users clicking the "Want To Read" button for that book; **and vice versa* for all of those 4 GoodReads metrics.

Weak Correlations:
* There are a few *very weak* correlations among the quantity of physical library book copies, total editions of physical library books within the library system, the GoodReads number of "Current Readers", & their number of "Want to Read"'s.
* There are also some *very weak* correlations between physical book *Price* vs. *GoodReads Ratings out of 5, Number of ratings, and Number of Reviews*. There is almost an **opposite** correlation between *library copies/book edition totals* and the book *Price* vs. *the aforementioned GoodReads ratings* & *Price*.
* I would not consider these weak correlations truly significant, though they're fun to look at on a graph.
